  "c1": "Since I wrote my first line of code, I discovered that programming is not just about solving problems, but also about creating possibilities. I am passionate about transforming ideas into digital solutions that work, inspire, and improve people's lives.\n I don't settle for something to just 'work': I strive for it to be efficient, scalable, and above all, useful. I believe that learning never ends, and every new project is an opportunity to grow, explore, and push boundaries.\n My goal is simple: to leave my mark on every project by bringing dedication, creativity, and the commitment to always deliver the best.",
